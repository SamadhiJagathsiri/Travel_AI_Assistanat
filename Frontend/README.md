# 🧠 RAG Workflow

When a user asks a question:

1. User query is embedded.
2. FAISS retrieves the most similar document chunks.
3. Similarity threshold removes weak matches.
4. LLM relevance validation checks whether retrieved chunks actually answer the user's question.
5. If relevant:
   - RAG prompt is used.
   - Source document is shown.
6. Otherwise:
   - General travel knowledge is used.
   - No source card is displayed.

This prevents unrelated travel guides from influencing responses.

# 🔍 Key Features

### General Travel Knowledge

Ask questions such as:

- Best places to visit in Japan
- Plan a trip to Italy
- Budget for Switzerland

without uploading any document.

---

### PDF-Based Answers

Upload a travel guide and ask:

- Local food
- Attractions
- Transportation
- Accommodation

The assistant automatically uses the uploaded guide whenever it is relevant.

---

### Intelligent Relevance Validation

The assistant does **not** blindly use uploaded documents.

A second-stage LLM validation step determines whether retrieved document chunks truly answer the user's question before RAG is applied.
